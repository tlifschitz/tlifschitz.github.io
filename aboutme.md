### Professional Background
- I currently work as an embedded systems engineer at [Maper](https://home.mapertech.com), a B2B industrial IoT startup, developing vibration wireless sensors among other monitoring devices.
- I am also a contributor to [SimpleBLE](https://github.com/OpenBluetoothToolbox/SimpleBLE), an open-source portable C++ BLE stack.
- As a contractor for a healthcare startup I have reverse-engineered Bluetooth communication protocols of [some commercial glucose meters](https://github.com/sivulich/AppiaGlucometers). This project helped to integrate these devices into their application and unlocked a partnership between the contracting startup with J&J.

### Technical Stack

I have a broad range of technical skills, involving almost all the abstraction layers of a solution. This allows me to have a holistic view of the whole architecture of the system I am working on.

My expertise includes hardware design, firmware development, application software, and some backend knowledge. Additionally, I am familiar with common data analysis and machine learning libraries, and I am always eager to learn new things.

* **Hardware**: Altium Designer, LTSpice, VHDL, Solid Edge, 3D printing
* **Firmware**: C, C++17, makefile, cmake, DSP, ChibiOS, Linux (Yocto)
* **Protocols**: UART, I2C, MODBUS, CAN, UDP, CoAP, MQTT, Thread / Matter
* **Data / ML**: Python, Jupyter, Grafana, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
* **Backend**: Django, PostgresDB, AWS EC2, Nginx
* **DevOps**: GIT, Docker, Gitlab CI/CD, Github Actions, Mender

### Interests
- I enjoy understanding how things work from the basic concepts. That explains my passion for math and physics during my university years.
- I like solving competitive programming tasks and have participated in some [competitions](/competitive-programming) with the CorDamp team, consistently finishing in the top 5% global ranking.
- Lately, I have been learning about domotics and DIY home automation.
- I am also an amateur musician, avid traveler, and coffee lover.

### Personal Background
- I grew up in *Tandil*, a medium-sized city in the Buenos Aires province.
- In 2001, when I was 5 years old, my family and I moved to *Bath, England*, following a job opportunity for my father. We lived there for one year, and I attended the first year of the UK primary education system.
- During my teens back in *Tandil*, I attended a technical school where I learned a solid basis in electrical theory and carried out electromechanics projects.
- I moved to *Buenos Aires* in 2015 for my university studies. A couple of years later, at the end of 2020, I got my degree in Electronics Engineering. Since then, I have been working full-time and enjoying living in this amazing city.
